            <h2>Joseph Smith—History 1:6</h2>
            <p>
                For, notwithstanding the great love which
                the converts to these different faiths
                expressed at the time of their conversion,
                and the great zeal manifested by the respective clergy,
                who were active in getting up and promoting
                this extraordinary scene of religious feeling,
                in order to have everybody converted,
                as they were pleased to call it,
                let them join what sect they pleased;
                yet when the converts began to file off,
                some to one party and some to another,
                it was seen that the seemingly good feelings of both
                the priests and the converts were more pretended than real;
                for a scene of great confusion and bad
                feeling ensued—priest contending against priest,
                and convert against convert; so that all their good
                feelings one for another, if they ever had any,
                were entirely lost in a strife of words
                and a contest about opinions.

            <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 6:33</h2>
            <p>
                Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever ye sow,
                that shall ye also reap; therefore,
                if ye sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward.
